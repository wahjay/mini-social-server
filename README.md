# Mini Social Media

This is a mini social media that I build in my personal time for fun as well as learning.

## Tech Stack
  * React
  * GraphQL
  * Nodejs
  * MongoDB
  * Cloudinary (for hosting/managing images)

## Perforamce improvement
 * Lazy loading posts, only rendering posts within the viewport.
 * Lazy loading comments, only rendering more when clicked `view more button`
 * Instead of rendering gif images as is, I render them in mp4 format, which is a lot smaller in size than the gif format.
 * Gif images will be paused automatically when out of the viewport.

## More Improvement in the future
 * Using a shimmer as a placeholder for loading images

## Things to fix next
 * Comment section currently doesn't have a gifpicker and a file uploader.
 * Add see more option on body texts.
